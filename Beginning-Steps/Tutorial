Git Tutorial

Interactive tutorial from github

https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

Tutorial Instructions:

Search for ’portable git’ in google.

Download ‘thumb drive’ version (these steps for windows users)

Open git-bash. This will open a bash prompt (time to start learning linux!) (or just open a terminal in linux)

Open https://github.com/ColTigh/CSU-Radar-Calibration/ repo in a browser and set aside for the time being

Clone the https://github.com/ColTigh/CSU-Radar-Calibration repo by typing the following into your bash command prompt

git clone https://github.com/ColTigh/CSU-Radar-Calibration

Navigate to your new ‘Beginng-Steps’ folder in the windows explorer (or for the pros you can ‘cd Beginng-Steps’)

Make a new folder with your first name and last initial (ex, elijaha) inside of the ‘Beginng-Steps’ directory

Make a new text file inside of your new folder, and type some text into your new file.

Go back to the bash command prompt and navigate to the top of the git repository (base directory a.k.a. the gittutorial folder) and type
the following, making sure to notice what each command is doing

git status

git add <folder you created>

git status

git commit –m “This is my first upload. <username>”

git push –u origin master

If the last command fails, it should say something along the lines of “There are changes in the master branch not reflected in your local
branch”. This means you need to pull the latest files before you can push anything. This helps to ensure people don’t overwrite new
changes that someone else has checked in by mistake. Since you have already ‘committed’ your changes in your local branch, simply run
the ‘git pull’ command to pull the latest changes to the repository. You will get a prompt with a message similar to “Merging branch..”
Once the pull has finished you can rerun the push command to push your changes.

Go back to your browser and refresh the page. You will now see your new folder and file as well as the folders and files that others have
made. USE THIS REPO TO TEST WITH BEFORE YOU BREAK THE REAL REPOSITORY!!
